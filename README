nensync readme v.1.1
http://nordicencryption.net - http://github.com/chr1573r/nensync

## What is nensync?

nensync and the other components found in this repository are a set of shell scripts(bash)
that aim to provide the functionality needed to operate a GNU/Linux based Nordic Encryption Net node.

In a nutshell, nensync will enable secure file sync between computers over the internet and/or LAN's through rsync/ssh.
Different utils for maintaining and making these transfered files more accessable will also be a part of this project.



More stuff will hopefully be added to this readme as the project matures
