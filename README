nensync readme v.1.0

## What is nensync?

nensync and the other components found in this repository is a set of shellscripts(bash)
that aim to provide the tools needed to maintain a Nordic Encryption Net node.

In a nutshell, nensync will enable secure file sync between computers over the internet and/or LAN's through rsync/ssh.
Different utils for maintaining and making these transfered files more accessable will also be a part of this project.



More stuff will hopefully be added to this readme as the project matures
